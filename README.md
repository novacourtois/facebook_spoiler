Facebook Spoilers
================

**Facebook Spoilers** is a Chrome Extension intended to remove spoilers from Facebook. Nobody wants to have the latest episode of their favorite show spoiled when checkng Facebook.


**How to Use**
In efforts to make it friendly for people who are not using the extension, the tags have been made to be unintrusive.

The **[Spoiler:]** tag begins the tag. If you don't close it, all the text following it will be selected.

To close the tag, simply use the **[:Spoiler]** tag.
Don't worry, it is case-insensitive.

**Example:**

**[Spoiler:]** This is a spoiler.

**[Spoiler:]** This is a spoiler.**[:Spoiler]** This is not a spoiler.

**To do**
Posts or comments with the #spoilers tag will be safe at some point.
